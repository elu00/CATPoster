    abstract = {We quantitatively study the interaction between diffusion and mixing in both the continuous, and discrete time setting. In discrete time, we consider a mixing dynamical system interposed with diffusion. In continuous time, we consider the advection diffusion equation where the advecting vector field is assumed to be sufficiently mixing. The main results of this paper is to estimate the dissipation time and energy decay based on an assumption quantifying the mixing rate.}

	journal = {Nonlinearity},
	abstract = {Mixing is relevant to many areas of science and engineering, including the pharmaceutical and food industries, oceanography, atmospheric sciences and civil engineering. In all these situations one goal is to quantify and often then to improve the degree of homogenization of a substance being stirred, referred to as a passive scalar or tracer. A classical measure of mixing is the variance of the concentration of the scalar, which is the L2 norm of a mean-zero concentration field. Recently, other norms have been used to quantify mixing, in particular the mix-norm as well as negative Sobolev norms. These norms have the advantage that unlike variance they decay even in the absence of diffusion, and their decay corresponds to the flow being mixing in the sense of ergodic theory. General Sobolev norms weigh scalar gradients differently, and are known as multiscale norms for mixing. We review the applications of such norms to mixing and transport, and show how they can be used to optimize the stirring and mixing of a decaying passive scalar. We then review recent work on the less-studied case of a continuously replenished scalar field—the source–sink problem. In that case the flows that optimally reduce the norms are associated with transport rather than mixing: they push sources onto sinks, and vice versa.}
